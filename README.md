###Documentation.###

Inspiration for this project came from http://rubykoans.com/ which can be found at https://github.com/neo/ruby_koans

The whole idea behind this C# project is to help people who are just starting off with the C# language to learn the syntax, methods, and Test Driven Development.
The idea behind Test Driven Development(TDD) is that you write tests first which fail and then implement the code which will make the test pass.
