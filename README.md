#####Introduction:#####

Inspiration for this project came from http://rubykoans.com/ which can be found at https://github.com/neo/ruby_koans

The whole idea behind this C# project is to help people who are just starting off with the C# language to learn the syntax, methods, and Test Driven Development.
The idea behind Test Driven Development(TDD) is that you write tests first which fail and then implement the code which will make the test pass.

If you are interested in more coding challenges similar to this then you may want to also look into Javascript Koans located at https://github.com/mrdavidlaing/javascript-koans 


#####Things to keep in mind:#####
The answers to these problems are located in the KoanAnswers.cs file which is in the CSharp-Koans folder.

Some of the tests will pass from the beginning since there are tests that check for the method to return false or true.  

In order to know that you have completed the method correctly you would want to verify to see that above the method it says all of the tests are passing.  For example the Is15 method should say 4 references | 4/4 passing. If you click on that it will pull up all of the tests that are associated with that method.
